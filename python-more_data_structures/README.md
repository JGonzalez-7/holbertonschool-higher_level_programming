# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

Exercises focused on Python sets, dictionaries, and additional sequence tools like comprehensions and `map`.

## Files
- `0-square_matrix_simple.py`: return a new matrix with each value squared.
- `1-search_replace.py`: build a new list replacing all occurrences of `search` with `replace`.
- `2-uniq_add.py`: add together the unique integers in a list.
- `3-common_elements.py`: return the set of items common to two sets.
- `4-only_diff_elements.py`: return the symmetric difference between two sets.
- `5-number_keys.py`: count how many keys are in a dictionary.
- `6-print_sorted_dictionary.py`: print dictionary items ordered by key.
- `7-update_dictionary.py`: replace or add a key/value pair, then return the dictionary.
- `8-simple_delete.py`: delete a key from a dictionary if it exists.
- `9-multiply_by_2.py`: build a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.
- `10-best_score.py`: return the key with the highest value or `None` when empty.
- `11-multiply_list_map.py`: use `map` to multiply every number in a list by a given factor.
- `12-roman_to_int.py`: convert a Roman numeral string to an integer, handling subtractive notation.

## Usage
Run any script with Python 3:
```bash
python3 <script>.py
```
Many files only expose functions; import them into your own code or tests to exercise their behaviors.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+ (Holberton baseline: Ubuntu 20.04 with Python 3.8).
- `pycodestyle` 2.8.* for style checks.
- Executable scripts should start with `#!/usr/bin/python3` and have the executable bit set (`chmod +x <script>.py`).
