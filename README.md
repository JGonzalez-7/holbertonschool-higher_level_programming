# holbertonschool-higher_level_programming

Higher level programming projects for Holberton School. Each folder is a standalone project with its own tasks and scripts.

## Repository structure
- `python-hello_world/`: introductory Python scripts covering printing, basic string handling, formatting, and running simple programs.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+ (Holberton baseline: Python 3.8 on Ubuntu 20.04).
- `pycodestyle` 2.8.\* for style checks.
- Scripts intended to run directly should start with `#!/usr/bin/python3` and be executable.

## Usage
1. `cd` into a project directory.
2. Run scripts with `python3 <script_name>.py`.

Example:
```bash
cd python-hello_world
python3 2-print.py
```

## Helpful commands
- `pycodestyle *.py` to lint files.
- `chmod +x <script_name>.py` if a script needs an executable bit.
